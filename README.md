# DevTime

DevTime is an open source project for developers to track, manage and show off their developer-time. Think
of it as a developer's diary, only that the entries will be done automatically.

This plugin collects statistics about the languages you use and projects you work on, and sends it over to
the [DevTime dashboard](https://devtime.tech) for you to see.

> Watches that go *tick, tick, tick* are OK, but what about a watch that ticks only when **you** *tick, tick, tick*
on your keyboard? <br />

That watch is DevTime's VS-Code extension.

Note that it does not send the specific code you write. It only and only uses statistics about the language,
editor and name of the project (can be anonymized) currently active.
